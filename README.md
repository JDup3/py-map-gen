# py-map-gen
Generates a random planet-like map with wrapped perlin noise.

![Example](images/sample_map.png)

## TODO
- [ ] Need more details in the readme :(
- [ ] I would like to make the code a little more readible by reducing the amount of pythonic idioms in hopes to make the algorithm more transparent. I do now want non-python users to be turned away.
- [ ] Further testing; only manually tested 2D maps

## Notice
Please checkout the original perlin generator from which this implementation extends:

Also, the owner created a well documented blog on this too, and
is very insightful: https://eev.ee/blog/2016/05/29/perlin-noise/
